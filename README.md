## Description

Uplift modeling is a new machine learning approach that allow to evaluate the effect of a treatment and optimize the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, individual offers, or personalized medicine. The uplift modeling is used to determine the user groups that will be most affected by the campaign treatment and the groups that do not need to be affected.

## Prerequisites

Main prerequisites are:

- [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/)
- [causaml](https://github.com/uber/causalml)
- [econml](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML)
- [scikit-uplift](https://github.com/maks-sh/scikit-uplift)
